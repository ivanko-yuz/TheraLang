## Adding features

To keep commit logs as clean as possible we use the GitHub workflow with feature
branches. This means:

1. **Never** write any code in your `master` branch
2. When writing code, do it in a specific feature branch
3. Send your pull request from that feature branch back to this repo
4. After your pull request has been accepted, sync the changes into your master from the upstream remote
5. Delete you feature branch
6. Again, **NEVER** write any code in your `master` branch
